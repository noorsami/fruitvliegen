PANCAKE SORT
Start off with Mel: [6, 21, 13, 23, 1, 11, 2, 15, 3, 8, 4, 9, 17, 18, 19, 12, 16, 20, 24, 5, 14, 7, 25, 22, 10]
Run algorithm so that genome-sequence turns in to Mir: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
Swap 1 : [1, 23, 13, 21, 6, 11, 2, 15, 3, 8, 4, 9, 17, 18, 19, 12, 16, 20, 24, 5, 14, 7, 25, 22, 10]
