POPULATION BASED ALGORITHM
-----------------------------
Start off with Mel: [11, 22, 8, 25, 3, 24, 10, 13, 12, 18, 7, 20, 9, 23, 14, 5, 21, 16, 2, 19, 6, 15, 4, 17, 1]
Run algorithm so that Mel turns in to Mir: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
Finding best mutated Mel per iteration out of the population size: 300
