POPULATION BASED ALGORITHM
-----------------------------
Start off with Mel: [13, 18, 12, 7, 10, 15, 25, 11, 21, 16, 20, 1, 24, 23, 9, 14, 19, 3, 17, 8, 6, 5, 22, 4, 2]
Run algorithm so that Mel turns in to Mir: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
